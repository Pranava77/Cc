      <h3>By James Clear</h3>
      <p>
        World-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered a simpler system
        for transforming your life. He knows that lasting change comes from the
        compound effect of hundreds of small decisions - doing two push-ups a
        day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call.
        He calls them atomic habits.

      <p>
        Earth is 4.5 billion years old. In just a fraction of that time, one
        species among countless others has conquered it: us. In this bold and
        provocative book, Yuval Noah Harari explores who we are, how we got here
        and where we're going.
